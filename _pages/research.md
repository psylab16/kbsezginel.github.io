Psychoacoustic Lab - University of Pittsburgh
---------------------------------------------

Research in the Psychoacoustics Laboratory is concerned mostly with the way in which the auditory system
processes temporally dynamic or time-varying sounds. This research has implications for the way in which we
perceive sounds such as speech and music.


A considerable amount of research addresses the effects of cochlear hearing loss on auditory perception. The goals of this
research are to understand the limitations imposed by hearing loss and to provide a strong basis for the
development of signal-processing strategies for assistive-listening devices such as hearing aids.
